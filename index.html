    <h1 class="heading">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h1>

    <p id="banner">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,
        anti-colonial
        nationalist,
        and political ethicist, who employed noviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's
        independence from British Rule, and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
        The
        honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is
        now
        used throughout the world.</p>

        <h2>Congress Politics

        </h2>
        <p>In 1934 Gandhi resigned from Congress party membership. He did not disagree with the party's position but
            felt
            that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which
            actually
            varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with
            pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. </p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi
            Smriti),
            on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into
            his
            chest from a pistol at close range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly.[181][182] In other
            accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a
            bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu
            scriptures.</p>

        <h2>Gandhism</h2>
        <p>Gandhism designates the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted; of central importance is nonviolent resistance.
            A
            Gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to,
            Gandhism.
